# Good Morning! It's WEDNESDAY, June 12, 2024

## Today

### Setup

Please go to https://labs.azure.com/virtualmachines and start and connect to your VM.

Once you are in your VM, please start Docker Desktop (it's the blue whale icon on the desktop in the VM.)
- No need to do *anything* once it starts.

I will review how to get my code if you want to start fresh this morning.
